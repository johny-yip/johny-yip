[GitHub](https://github.com/) provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc.

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is a free and open source automation server. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that helps software teams work smarter, faster.

[AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. With CodeBuild, you don't need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation.

[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is an open-source build-automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration.

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp.It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

[AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/) is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to a variety of compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines.

[PowerShell/PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

[Rancher](https://rancher.com/) is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers. It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is the Kubernetes Package Manager.

[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works with popular enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for heterogeneous infrastructure.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a free software application used for event monitoring and alerting. It records real-time metrics in a time series database (allowing for high dimensionality) built using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting.

[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed in Java.

[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) is a tool for managing events and logs. When used generically, the term encompasses a larger system of log collection, processing, storage and searching activities.

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) is an open source data visualization plugin for Elasticsearch. It provides visualization capabilities on top of the content indexed on an Elasticsearch cluster. Users can create bar, line and scatter plots, or pie charts and maps on top of large volumes of data.

[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities on 20+ programming languages.

[Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/) is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a proprietary issue tracking product developed by Atlassian that allows bug tracking and agile project management.

[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) is the agile project management tool of choice for developers around the world for real-time collaboration around a shared, prioritized backlog.

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application that gives you perspective over all your projects, at work and at home.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a cloud-based proprietary instant messaging platform developed by Slack Technologies.
